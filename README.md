## Software

Firmware of this device started as a simple port of [ESPKey](https://github.com/octosavvi/ESPKey) for ESP32C3, that gradually grew into extensible and multi-protocol software project, with own improved hardware.

### Features

Currently, the firmware can be built with following features:

#### Communication interfaces

| build flag         | description                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| USE_BLE            | BLEKey-style Bluetooth Low Energy support                                     |
| USE_WIFI           | ESPKey-style WiFi (station or client) support                                 |
| USE_HTTP           | HTTP user interface                                                           |

#### Firmware upgrade

| build flag         | description                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| USE_OTA            | Arduino-style over-the-air upgrade                                            |
| USE_OTA_HTTP       | HTTP endpoint for upgrading firmware                                          |

There's an USB connector on-board, that even features embedded JTAG interface, but why not...

#### External reporting

| build flag         | description                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| USE_MDNS_RESPONDER | broadcasts MDNS, so hostname instead of IP address can be used for a connection |
| USE_SYSLOG         | reports interactions to syslog server                                         |
| USE_LCD            | reports interactions to a handy I2C OLED display                              |

#### Wire protocols

| build flag         | description                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| USE_WIEGAND        | provides support for Wiegand interface sniffing and transmitting              |
| USE_CLOCKANDDATA   | provides support for clock&data interface sniffing and transmitting           |
| USE_OSDP           | breaks the build, as it is not implemented yet                                |

**In Wiegand mode**, the device can receive (sniff) and transmit messages of any length.  
Assignment of D0 and D1 lines can be corrected in the configuration file after the device installation, if needed.  
The device was sucessfuly tested with 5V and 12V PACS systems, that uses different card number lengths.

**In Clock&Data mode**, the device can receive and transmit messages of any reasonable length.  
Assignment of DATA and CLOCK lines can be corrected in configuration file after the device installation, if needed.  
The device was sucessfuly tested with 12V Clock&Data system, running in Magstripe and UNITEK-emulation modes.  
Support for Paxton decoding is based on samples provided by [en4rab](https://github.com/en4rab/sigrok-paxton-pd).

### Build instructions

Open the project in PlatformIO and press "Upload", then "Upload Filesystem Image". The code is Arduino-flavoured, but takes too long for me to compile using Arduino IDE.

![the required project tasks](docs/img/platformio_build.png)

### HTTP interface

If built with *USE_HTTP* flag, the device provides a quite-eye candy, simple HTTP interface, based on almost-REST API and built using jQuery and Bootstrap.

![wiegand interface screenshot](docs/img/http.png)

Currently, it offers following features:

* review and modification of application configuration files,
* review of sniffed reader interactions,
* replay of acquired credentials,
* sending arbitrary card numbers (raw or encoded in common formats)

### BLE interface

If built with *USE_BLE* flag, the device exposes a custom Bluetooth Low Energy interface:

![device characteristics inspected in nRF Connect](docs/img/ble.jpg)

Currently, it offers following features:

* reading the last sniffed card,
* notifying about new interactions,
* sending arbitrary card number.

The device currently does not support pairing nor bonding.
Feature-wise is simillar to [BLEKey](https://github.com/linklayer/BLEKey) by Mark Baseggio and Eric Evenchick, but running on a decade-younger hardware.

By default, functions are exposed in service *f498124f-2137-4615-9859-30eb4cecffb5* as characteristic *beb5483e-36e1-4688-b7f5-ea07361baaaa*. These UUIDs can be modified in the device configuration.

There is planned a Flipper Zero client, that will be publicly released shortly after BLE Central role will be incorporated in its firmware (probably never).

### OTA upgrade

By properly configuring the build flags, the firmware can feature OTA-upgrade. BLE will have to be sacrificed to fit two copies of firmware in device flash.

It is possible to use Arduino-style OTA (but I never did) or upload firmware images over HTTP endpoint, depending on the build configuration.

## Hardware

The device not only fits behind readers, but also fits the cheapest G3061 hot-plate you can get.
It solders nicely with carelessly and generously hand applied solder paste:

### ESP32-C3

The device utilizes ESP32C3FN4 on a ready-made ESP32-C3 SuperMini module.
Personally, I recommend ordering insignificantly more expensive "Plus" version made by TENSTAR, with an external antenna connector, as some of the regular modules comes with incorrect antenna design, resulting in [impresively poor WiFi range](https://www.reddit.com/r/esp32/comments/1dsh3b5/warning_some_c3_super_mini_boards_have_a_design/).

![Supermini plus](docs/img/esp32c3_supermini_plus.png)

### DC-DC converter

The power supply uses [LMR51430](https://www.ti.com/product/LMR51430) synchronous buck step-down converter, rated at up to 36V. It is designed to run at 1.1 MHz switching frequency, to use a relatively small inductor, while maintaining high efficiency with a relatively light load.
Maximum voltage if further limited by voltage rating of installed C5 capacitor and F1 resetable polyfuse, but components from the BOM are sufficient to safely run it with 24V-powered long-range readers.

As no linear voltage regulator in used, both power consumption and heat dissipation is minimal.
The device is also protected against reverse polarity - it just doesn't start, but doesn't blow up.

### Battery operation

The device DC-DC converter is configured to turn off at approximately at 6V and start at 6.4V, to provide an overdischarge protection if the device is operated from 2S lithium-ion polymer battery pack. Battery voltage can be measured using device ADC and read in device web interface.

### Level shifter

Absolute maximum drain-source voltage rating for 2N7002 N-channel MOSFET transistor is 60V.
The board is definitelty not designed for such volatage and I advise against connecting it to live installations of such voltage levels, but it is much more than 5-12V usually found in access control systems anyway.

![level shifter](docs/img/shifter.jpg)

Voltage shifter is derived from "Bi-directional level shifter for I¬≤C-bus and other systems" design described in Philips Semiconductors application note AN97055:

![AN97055 extract](docs/img/an97055.jpg)

This solution works properly in installations with external pull-up (e.g. provided by the reader sharing the same line) regardless of the voltage levels, providing a convenient way of pulling it down to GND.
It does not provide a way of pulling the line up to VCC.

### RS-485 transceiver

The device design incorporates [THVD1424](https://www.ti.com/product/THVD1424) transceiver intended for interacting with OSDP readers.
It is configured in single-pair, half-duplex mode and provides switchable bus termination.
Populating the transceiver on the PCB limits maximum safe communication lines voltage to 16V.

The code present currently in the device firmware configures the transceiver into high impedance mode to avoid interferrence.

### LCD support

The device supports connecting SSD1306-based 128X32 OLED to visualize reader interactions.
Two Wire Interface Bus is available on pin 8 (SDA) and 9 (SCL) of Supermini.

![connected OLED screen](docs/img/lcd.jpg)

In the current hardware revision there is no dedicated connector due to PCB spatial constraints, so use your soldering iron.

### Solder bridges

The device features 3 solder bridges (hardware switches easily operated with a soldering iron):

* JP1 (close to THVD1424): enables half-duplex operation of RS-485 transceiver,
* JP2 (close to inductor): enables supplying power from the converter to ESP32,
* JP3 (on the reverse side): directly connects USB 5V to device VDC - can be used to supply 5V to the connected reader, to create standalone "door-in-the-box" device.

Due to unexplored reasons, all three are labeled "JP2" on the silkscreen.

### Connectors

The current PCB revision uses KYOCERA AVX insulation displacement connectors of 9175-000 series, designed for 26 AWG stranded or solid wires. It is planned to switch to 9176-000 series, to support wires up to 20 AWG. If connecting the device to thick wires is needed, it is currently recommended to use supplementary automotive IDC T2 tap connectors.
